# caesars-decipher
bad and suboptimal automatic decryptor for text encrypted with caesar's cipher

After compiling the code, put the executable in the directory with the ciphered text you want to decode. The text has to be written in a file named "input.txt". After running the executable the decyphered text should be outputted to "output.txt" as well as written to console.
